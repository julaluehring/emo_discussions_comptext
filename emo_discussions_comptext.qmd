## Emotions and Misinformation

::: incremental
-   Misinformation as inaccurate information

    -   Symptom of a partisan information ecosystem
  
-  Missing link in partisan-based processing: emotions

    -   Arousing emotions are signals to make us better select, process and memorize information
    
    -   But also hinder systematic processing

-   In the context of misinformation, arousing emotions may reinforce partisan-biased processing

:::

::: notes
-   So when we talk about misinformation, we usually refer to inaccurate information, regardless of the intention. 

-   Despite concerns about misinformation, it now seems as a symptom of a clustered information ecosystem where few people are exposed to misinformation, while most people have partisan information diets, including decontextualized but not completely inaccurate information

-   In this process, a missing link are emotions 

-   While arousing, mobilizing emotions signal us to better select, process and memorize vital information

-   Which, in theory, is good, they can also hinder systematic processing 

-   In the case of misinformation, arousing emotions may therefore reinforce partisan-based processing 
:::

## Misinformation on social media

::: incremental

-   Negative, arousing emotions attract attention

-   High engagement: angry, moralizing and negative content

-   Misinformation is embedded in emotional dynamics and intergoup conflict

### Questions
-  What are the effects of misinformation on online discussions?

      -  emotions
      -  engagement

:::

::: notes
-   On social media, arousing emotions attract attention and higher engagement, reflecting a function of emotions, namely grabbing attention

-   Content that is highly arousing and negative gets higher engagement, typically, this is moralizing and conflictual content 

-   So we would also expect misinformation to be embedded in such emotional dynamics, anger, and intergroup conflict but while this makes a lot of sense in theory, research on this is mixed because 
a) it is hard to trigger emotions in a lab setting and
b) the observational evidence that we have is mostly based on survey or social media data from the US

-   Therefore, we were wondering what the effects of misinformation are on online discussions, do they trigger conflict and anger, and does this then lead to higher engagement? 
:::

## Problems

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
1.  Misinformation is often measured as clearly true or false instances,

        -   neglecting less extreme types,
        
        -   making it hard to isolate effects of misinformation
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
2.  Different effects of emotions are overlooked

        -   by measuring positive and negative sentiment only,
      
        -   mixing up emotional reactions with prior state, stimuli, etc.,
      
        -   ignoring the function of emotions.

:::

::: notes
-   We identified two problems that we wanted to tackle in this study

-   First, misinformation is often measured as clearly false, fact-checked instances, which ignores less extreme and more influential types of misinformation, for instance biased news, and it makes it hard to isolate the effects from real news
      
      -   So the question is, are the effects that we are observing unique to misinformation?

-   Second, emotions are functional; and the function of emotions hinges on the interaction of prior beliefs and content. Therefore, measuring only positive and negative sentiment, or mixing up emotional state with emotional reactions overlooks the contextual effects of different emotions.

## Objectives


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
1.  Collecting a **systematic, large-scale and long-term dataset** for the German-speaking context

### Continuous trustworthiness ratings by NewsGuard (#1)
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
2.  Approximating **causal inference** to test the effects of misinformation on online discussions

### Nonparametric matching strategy (#2)
:::
:::
:::


::: notes
- So, we derived 2 major objectives: 

- First, we wanted to collect a systematic, large-scale and long-term dataset that relies on continuous trustworthiness ratings for sources, including biased but relatively trustworthy sources so that it reflects the whole spectrum of news trustworthiness

- Second, we tried a matching approach to approximate causal inference so that we could isolate the effects of untrustworthy sources
:::

# Data collection
::: notes
Let's talk about the data
:::

## Emotion inference

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
*N* = 9.3M Twitter discussions following 347 German news domains (20.6M tweets total)

::: fragment
![](images/daily_emotions_complete.png){width="600"}
:::
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
NewsGuard 

(0-100):

    - 93.8% trustworthy (>60)
    

::: fragment
Classification:

    - 8 emotions (Widmann & Wich, 2022; Macro F1=0.7)

    - Out-group references (Lasser at al., 2023; F1=0.8)

:::

::: notes
-   We collected roughly 9 million twitter discussions where a German news domain was shared as the first tweet, with 20M tweets in total. For those news domains, we have a trustworthiness rating from NewsGuard, therefore, we understand misinformation here as news from untrustworthy sources
-   For each tweet, we then classified 8 distinct emotions and out-group references from text 
-   This plot shows the covered time frame from October 2020 to March 2022 and we can already see that anger is overall much higher 

:::

# Part I: Discussions

::: notes
- Now, we are zooming in on the tweets that got at least one reply and the following discussion thread
:::

## Nonparametric matching

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](images/mahalanobis_plot_wd.png){width="700"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
Nearest Neighbor and Mahalanobis distance

$\rightarrow$ *N* = 87,132
:::

Conditions: Untrustworthy vs. trustworthy (\>60)

Covariates: PO, word count, following/followers, time difference, emotions

:::

::: notes
NewsGuard sets a threshold at a trustworthiness score at 60, such that sources below 60 are considered untrustworthy 

We used this classification to create two conditions (trustworthy vs untrustworthy) and then applied a nonparametric matching approach to balance the dataset based on a set of covariates

Those are the political orientation of the source, the initial emotion in the tweet, following, follower and tweet counts, as well as the word count of the first tweet

We also included the time difference between the first reply and the last to control for collective emotional development

This plot shows the initial standardized mean difference between the two conditions in white dots and the balanced data in black, where we can see that we reduced it to almost 0 for most covariates, so we literally hold them constant

This approach reduced the balanced dataset to 87,000 discussions

## Do emotions differ based on trustworthiness?

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
![](images/mean_emotion_matched-95.png){width="600"} ~Models: OLS regressions~
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
::: fragment

$\rightarrow$ More anger and out-group references

$\rightarrow$ Less joy
:::
:::
:::

::: notes
Here, we can see the regression coefficients testing the effect of the treatment on the emotions in both the whole discussion aggregated and only the first response to the stimuli

-   In both, there are significant differences in most emotions, except for enthusiasm, however, we observe substantially more anger, more out-group references and less joy in response to untrustworthy information
:::

## But the covariates?

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](images/full_regression_coeff_matched-wd_anger_joy.png){width="600"}
~Models: OLS regressions~
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

Emotion in the discussion reflects emotion in news post

:::
:::

::: notes
When we take a closer look at the effect of each covariate, we see a very interesting pattern overall: The emotion in the discussion reflects emotion in news post
::: 

## But the covariates?

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](images/anger.png){width="600"}
~Models: OLS regressions~
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

Emotion in the discussion reflects emotion in news post

:::
:::
::: notes
-   Here, for anger
:::

## But the covariates?

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](images/joy.png){width="600"}
~Models: OLS regressions~
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

Emotion in the discussion reflects emotion in news post

:::

:::
::: fragment
### $\rightarrow$ Trustworthiness barely predicts emotions
:::

::: notes
-  And for joy
-  Such that trustworthiness barely seems to predict any changes in emotions in the discussion
::: 

# Part II: Discussion starter

::: notes
In a second step, we wanted to zoom out again and look at the discussion starters in the unbalanced dataset and including discussions with no replies 
::: 

## Do posts with lower trustworthiness include more anger?

![](images/initial_emo_coeff.png){width="600"}

### $\rightarrow$ Lower trustworthiness = anger

### $\rightarrow$ Higher trustworthiness = joy

::: notes
We especially wanted to see if tweets with a lower trustworthiness score also included more anger, explaining why there is more anger in the discussion
And that's also what we found!
Anger decreases when trustworthiness increases
While joy increases when trustworthiness increases
:::

## Is lower trustworthiness associated with higher engagement?

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
~Models: Zero-inflated Negative Binomial (log-link)~

~Controls: PO, word count, following, initial emotions~

![](images/models_zinb_estimates-se.png){width="600"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/reply_distributions.png){width="300"}
:::

::: fragment
$\rightarrow$ Trustworthy sources get substantially more likes
$\rightarrow$ Excluding excess zeroes, untrustworthy sources get more retweets and quotes
:::
:::

::: footer
Zeileis et al., [2008](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v27/i08/)
:::

::: notes
Lastly, we wanted to look at the associations between trustworthiness and engagement

Here, we included the zero replies, which zero-inflated the distribution, which you can see in the top corner

-   The results of our logistic regression model show that trustworthy information generally gets more likes than untrustworthy information

-   And the count model shows that, when excess zeroes are excluded, a lower trustworthiness score is associated with more retweets and quote retweets
:::

# Conclusion (tentative)
::: notes
The conclusion so far
:::

## Emotions $\rightarrow$ emotions $\rightarrow$ engagement?

::: incremental
-   Sources with low trustworthiness predict anger and out-group references
-   Emotions in discussions largely reflect emotions in initial post
-   Is engagement with low trustworthiness due to covariates?
:::

::: notes
-   Low trustworthiness predicts anger and conflict in discussions
-   But, emotions in discussions largely reflect emotions in initial posts
-   Therefore, we assume that misinformation includes more anger and conflict, which leads to engagement, not the trustworthiness
