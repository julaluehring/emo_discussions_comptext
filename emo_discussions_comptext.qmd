## Emotions

Research on the role of emotions in this context is mixed. While emotions are said to make people more susceptible to accepting misinformation----defined as inaccurate information----, we found in a previous study that this relationship is contingent on the prior beliefs of participants (Luehring, Shetty, et al., 2023). In other words, the function of emotions hinges on the interaction of prior beliefs and content (Van Damme & Smets, 2014), such that people with different prior beliefs experience and express one and the same emotion for different reasons.

-   Higher anger in people **good & bad** at recognizing false news
-   Angry responses because most people **recognize** false news
-   Emotions arise when information contradicts existing beliefs
