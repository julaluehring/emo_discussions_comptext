# WORK IN PROGRESS

## Misinformation risk assessment

::: columns

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: fragment
Or strong effects on only few people? Decrease in trust?
:::
:::
:::

::: fragment
::: incremental
*Problem*: Often measured as few clearly true or false instances,

a)  neglecting less extreme types of misinformation and
b)  making it hard to isolate effects of misinformation

## What are effects of misinformation?

::: incremental
-   Misperceptions, but only up to 5% believe in misinformation
-   Knowledge gaps
-   Reinforcing partisan sorting & conflict
:::

## Emotional reactions to misinformation

-   Function of emotions hinges on the interaction of prior beliefs and content (Van Damme & Smets, 2014)

```{r, out.width=1000, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/curvi-linear.svg")
```

::: incremental
-   Higher anger in people **good & bad** at recognizing false news
-   Angry responses because most people **recognize** false news Emotions arise when information contradicts existing beliefs!

## Social Media

-   On social media, emotions attract attention & increase sharing
-   Conflict, group & emotion dynamics are central on social media (Bail)

::: incremental
More *problems*:

-   Positive and negative sentiment only, overlooking the different effects of distinct emotions

-   Distinction of emotions within news from reactions to the news
:::

## Objectives

<center>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  Collecting a **systematic, large-scale and long-term data set** for the German-speaking context

    -   including trustworthy and untrustworthy news
    -   and the whole political spectrum
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
2.  Using a nonparametric matching strategy to approximate **causal inference** to test the effects of misinformation on online discussions
:::

# Data collection

## Emotion inference

*N* = 9.3M Twitter discussions following 347 German news domains (20.6M total)

# Results

## Engagement

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](images/main_nb_estimates.png){width="562"} Negative Binomial Models (Log-Link)
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
::: fragment
News trustworthiness is associated with more contextual engagement
:::
:::
:::

::: columns
Controls: political orientation, word count, author following count, emotions in first tweet
:::

## Emotions

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/fm_coeff_matched.jpg){width="562"} OLS regressions with nonparametric matching
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
::: fragment
More anger and out-group references in response to sources with low trustworthiness
:::
:::
:::

::: Controls: political orientation, word count, following/follower count, emotions :::

## Covariates

# Conclusion

## Tentative take-away messages

## Next steps

-   double-check model fit by bootstrapping distributions
-   network graphs of discussion (Gonzalez-Bailon)
-   analyzing responses in same users
