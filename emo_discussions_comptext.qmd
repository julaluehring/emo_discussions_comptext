## Emotions and Misinformation

::: incremental

-   Misinformation as inaccurate information

-   Arousing emotions are signal to make us better select, process and memorize information

-   In the case of misinformation, arousing emotions may 

    -   make people more vulnerable to misinformation (as a moderator)

    -   and increase effects of misinformation (as a mediator)

-   **But:** the function of emotions is complex and hinges on the interaction of prior beliefs and content

::: {.notes}
- Misinformation is used as an umbrella term and broadly captures all types of inaccurate information, regardless of the intention
- Generally, most people are driven by accuracy, but they fall for misinformation when it aligns with their partisan biases 
- In this process, a missing link seem to be emotions because arousing, mobilizing emotions signal us to better select, process and memorize vital information
- which in theory, this is good, but, in some situations, they can also hinder systematic processing 
- In the case of misinformation, we expect the latter: here, emotions can have a reinforcing effect and trick us into believing and engaging with misinformation
- However, emotions are functional; therefore, also the function of emotions hinges on the interaction of prior beliefs and content
:::


## Misinformation on social media

-   Negative, arousing emotions attract attention and increase sharing

-   High engagement: highly emotional, moralizing and negative content 	

-   Misinformation is embedded in group & emotion dynamics


Q: Do negative, arousing emotions drive engagement with misinformation?

Q: What is the role of inter-group conflict?

::: {.notes}
- On social media, we also expect that negative, arousing emotions attract attention and increase sharing. 
- Content that is highly arousing and negative gets higher engagement
- Also here, misinformation is embedded in group and emotional dynamics
- We therefore wonder if negative arousing emotions drive engagement with misinformation?
- And what is the role of intergroup conflict in this, as a factor that can explain the direction of emotions

## Problems

::: columns 

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: fragment
### #1:
Misinformation is measured as clearly true or false instances,

    1.  neglecting less extreme types of misinformation and
    
    2.  making it hard to isolate effects of misinformation
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
### #2:
Different effects of emotions are often overlooked,

    1. by measuring positive and negative sentiment only,

    2. because emotions within news are mixed up with reactions to the news,

    3. ignoring the meaning of emotions (first response and aggregate effects)

## Objectives

1.  Collecting a **systematic, large-scale and long-term dataset** for the German-speaking context

### Continuous trustworthiness ratings by NewsGuard (#1)

2.  Approximating **causal inference** to test the effects of misinformation on online discussions

### Nonparametric matching strategy (#2)

Therefore, we derive 2 major objectives:

# Data collection

## Emotion inference

*N* = 9.3M Twitter discussions following 347 German news domains (20.6M total)

NewsGuard (0-100):

    -  18.9% left/21.8% right

Classification:

    - 8 emotions (Widmann & Wich, 2022; Macro F1=0.7)

    - Out-group references (Lasser at al., 2023; F1=0.8)

# Conclusion (tentative)

## Take-away messages

-   Emotions in discussions largely reflect emotions in initial post
-   Sources with low trustworthiness are related to anger and out-group references

More negative emotions in misinformation $\rightarrow$ more emotions in response $\rightarrow$ more engagement?

## Up next

-   analyzing responses in within-users (reponding to trustworthy and untrustworthy posts)
-   robustness checks with multinomial models and bootstrapping
-   characterizing the full discussion trees
